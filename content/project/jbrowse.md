At the end of the 20th century, bioinformatics hackers were also web pioneers,
with our [Perl scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGI.pm) powering the likes of Amazon.
Sadly, things have gone downhill (relatively speaking), and bioinformatics tools these days are generally not nearly as usable as consumer-facing websites.

Our goal is to change that by taking front-end engineering as seriously, in genomics, as it is in Silicon Valley.
[JBrowse](http://jbrowse.org/), our JavaScript genome browser, uses modern infrastructure (e.g. npm, React, TypeScript) and a modular plugin-based approach.
It's highly popular for small genome projects, logging over 110k [Monthly Active Users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_users);
Colin Diesh maintains a list of [awesome sites that use it](https://github.com/cmdcolin/awesome-jbrowse).
JBrowse is also the basis for [Apollo](http://genomearchitect.org/), our collaborative genome annotation tool.

We are actively extending JBrowse for applications in cancer (particularly the visualization of [structural variation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_variation))
and comparative genomics.
