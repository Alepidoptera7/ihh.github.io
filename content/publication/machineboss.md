abstract = "Many software libraries for using Hidden Markov Models in bioinformatics focus on inference tasks, such as likelihood calculation, parameter-fitting, and alignment. However, construction of the state machines can be a laborious task, automation of which would be time-saving and less error-prone. Results. We present Machine Boss, a software tool implementing not just inference and parameter-fitting algorithms, but also a set of operations for manipulating and combining automata. The aim is to make prototyping of bioinformatics HMMs as quick and easy as the construction of regular expressions, with one-line “recipes” for many common applications. We report data from several illustrative examples involving protein-to-DNA alignment, DNA data storage, and nanopore sequence analysis."
