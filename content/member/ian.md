In the 80's, as an 8-bit game developer, I became interested in artificial life.
In the 90's I studied physics, then did a PhD on molecular evolution of transposons in the nematode genome,
advised by Richard Durbin at the Sanger Institute.
Then I came to Berkeley (via Los Alamos) to think about RNA.

In 2004 I moved from my first faculty job at Oxford's Department of Statistics (2002-2004) to join the faculty on UC Berkeley,
going from a postdoc on an exchange visa (1999-2002) to co-chair of the Bioengineering PhD program (2019-23).

My Berkeley group's research has spanned a broad range of algorithm and tool development for bioinformatics,
often relating to molecular evolution and comparative genomics.
