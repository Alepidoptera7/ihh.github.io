After graduating with my undergraduate degree in physics (with an emphasis in
biophysics), I found myself drawn toward genomics. That led me to pursue a
Masters degree in Bioinformatics through Brandeis University's online program,
where I developed my passion for bioinformatics software.

I joined the JBrowse team in 2018, just before work on JBrowse 2 started. I
very much enjoy the remote format of the JBrowse development team, and am
currently living in my home state of Utah.
