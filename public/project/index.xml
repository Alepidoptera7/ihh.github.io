      <description>A natural question for a mathematical scientist, in any field with enough data, is: what are the underlying dynamics, and the equations describing them? For Newtonian systems, this gives us the laws of motion; for statistical mechanics, we get Brownian motion and diffusion.
In molecular evolution, the underlying dynamics involve sequences, populations, and trees. The equations describe mutation of sequences, migration of lineages, and genealogical coalescence of samples. These equations are necessarily statistical in nature; both because evolution is inherently random, and also because (as in statistical physics) we can approximate a lot of the complicated deterministic parts with random models too.</description>

      <description>At the end of the 20th century, bioinformatics hackers were also web pioneers, with our Perl scripts powering the likes of Amazon. Sadly, things have gone downhill (relatively speaking), and bioinformatics tools these days are generally not nearly as usable as consumer-facing websites.
Our goal is to change that by taking front-end engineering as seriously, in genomics, as it is in Silicon Valley. JBrowse, our JavaScript genome browser, uses modern infrastructure (e.</description>
